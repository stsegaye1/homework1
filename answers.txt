What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is when someone wants to integrate the updated changes from their local repository to the working directory.
This can result in merge conflicts if two people have made conflicting changes to the same files.

A rebase is done when you want to update the start of your branch to a later commit that happened after you branched out.

Therefore merge and rebase do different things: merge is a way of COMBINING changes from one branch (source branch) into another branch (target branch) 
and rebase is a way of MOVING the changes from one branch onto another branch.
